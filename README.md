[![pages-build-deployment](https://github.com/mayrmt/mayrmt.github.io/actions/workflows/pages/pages-build-deployment/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/mayrmt/mayrmt.github.io/actions/workflows/pages/pages-build-deployment)

This is the GitHub repositpry for my personal website hosted at
https://mayrmt.github.io.

This site uses the [GitHub Pages Jeykyll Minima theme](https://jekyll.github.io/minima/).

To develop on this site, you need to have Ruby and jeykll installed locally.
To locally inspect changes, you need to run:

```bash
$ bundle exec jekyll serve
```

inside of the base git repository directory.
Then, the site can be viewed in your local browser at the address given in the terminal.
