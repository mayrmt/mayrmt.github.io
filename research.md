My research interests evolve around discretization and solution techniques for coupled multi-physics problems.
I'm particularly interested in multi-level block preconditioners for monolithic solution schemes.

# Research Interests

- Coupled multi-physics problems, monolithic & partitioned coupling schemes
- Fluid-structure interaction, magneto-hydrodynamics (MHD), electromagnetics
- Contact & interface mechanics
- Multi-scale phenomena
- Cardiovascular mechanics, biomedical engineering
- Parallel linear solvers & preconditioning, multi-level methods, nonlinear solvers
- Time integration, error estimation, implicit/explicit (IMEX) schemes
- Numerical methods for PDEs, Finite Element Methods, Mortar methods
- High Performance Computing, Algorithms for Novel Hardware Architectures
- Data-driven modelling

# Scientific Software Development

I'm an active contributor to several multiphysics codes and HPC math algorithm libraries:

- [Baci](https://baci.pages.gitlab.lrz.de/website): in-house multiphysics code (in collaboration with [LnM@TUM](www.lnm.mw.tum.de), [IMCS@UniBwM](www.unibw.de/imcs-en), and [HZG](https://www.hereon.de/institutes/material_systems_modeling/index.php.de))
- Drekar: in-house multi-fluid plasma code (Sandia National Laboratories)
- [Trilinos](https://trilinos.github.io): open-source project for algorithms for large-scale multiphsyics applications
- [MueLu](https://trilinos.github.io/muelu.html): next-generation multigrid framework within Trilinos
- [Spack](https://spack.io/): flexible package manager for HPC
- [TriBITS](http://tribits.org): software development, testing, and deployment system based on CMake
